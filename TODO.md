# general

* i want to scrape the whole data from pokeapi. (in case of limits/updates i do not want etc.)
    * although it is huge, it is static, does not change. so seems doable.

# typing game

* throw a pokeball when a pokemon's whole name is typed.
    * it should be small not to affect ui/ux in a bad way. diff. kind of pokeballs may be used.
* typing logic should be the same/very similar to zty.pe.
    * there will be no text field, user will see what they wrote from the pokemon whose name is being typed.
* while a pokemon's name is being typed, it should move slower
* stop button
